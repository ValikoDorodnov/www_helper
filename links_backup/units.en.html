  <div class=section id=units>
   <h2><code>em</code>, <code>px</code>, <code>pt</code>, <code
    >cm</code>, <code>in</code>…</h2>

   <p>CSS offers a number of different units for expressing length.
    Some have their history in typography, such as point (<code
    >pt</code>) and pica (<code>pc</code>), others are known from
    everyday use, such as centimeter (<code>cm</code>) and inch
    (<code>in</code>). And there is also a “magic” unit that was
    invented specifically for CSS: the <code>px</code>. Does that
    mean different properties need different units?

   <p>No, the units have nothing to do with the properties, but
    everything with the output media: screen or paper.

   <p>There is no restriction on which units can be used where. If a
    property accepts a value in <code>px</code> (<code>margin:
    5px</code>) it also accepts a value in inches or centimeters
    (<code>margin: 1.2in; margin: 0.5cm</code>) and vice-versa.

   <p>But in general you would use a different set of units for
    display on screen than for printing on paper. The following table
    gives the recommended use:

   <table><col><col><col><col>
    <thead>
     <tr>
      <th>

      <th>Rec­om­mended

      <th>Oc­ca­sional use

      <th>Not rec­om­mended

    <tbody>
     <tr>
      <th>Screen

      <td>em, px, %

      <td>ex

      <td>pt, cm, mm, in, pc

     <tr>
      <th>Print

      <td>em, cm, mm, in, pt, pc, %

      <td>px, ex

      <td>
   </table>

   <p>The relation between the absolute units is as follows: 1in =
    2.54cm = 25.4mm = 72pt = 6pc

   <div class=hint>
    <p>If you have a ruler handy you can check how precise your device
     is: here is a box of 1in (2.54cm) high: <span
     style="display: block; height: 72pt; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid dashed; line-height: 24pt; font-size: 19pt; text-align: center; margin: 1.2em"
     >↑<br>
     72pt<br>
     ↓</span>
   </div>

   <p>The so-called <em>absolute</em> units (<code>cm</code>,
    <code>mm</code>, <code>in</code>, <code>pt</code> and <code
    >pc</code>) mean the same in CSS as everywhere else, <em>but only
    if your output device has a high enough resolution.</em> On a
    laser printer, 1cm should be exactly 1 centimeter. But on
    low-resolution devices, such as computer screens, CSS doesn't
    require that. And indeed, the result tends to be different from one
    device to another and from one CSS implementation to another. It's
    better to reserve these units for high-resolution devices and in
    particular for printed output. On computer screens and handheld
    devices, you'll probably not get what you expect.

   <div class=hint id=abs-print>
    <p>In the past, CSS required that implementations display absolute
     units correctly even on computer screens. But as the number of
     incorrect implementations outnumbered correct ones and the
     situation didn't seem to improve, CSS abandoned that requirement
     in 2011. Currently, absolute units must work correctly only on
     printed output and on high-resolution devices.

    <p>CSS doesn't define what “high resolution” means. But as low-end
     printers nowadays start at 300 dpi and high-end screens are at
     200 dpi, the cut-off is probably somewhere in between.
   </div>

   <p>There is another reason to avoid absolute units for other uses
    than print: You look at different screens from different distances.
    1cm on a desktop screen looks small. But the same on a mobile phone
    directly in front of your eyes looks big. It's better to use
    relative units, such as <code>em</code>, instead.

   <p>The <code>em</code> and <code>ex</code> units depend on the
    font and may be different for each element in the document. The
    <code>em</code> is simply the font size. In an element with a 2in
    font, 1em thus means 2in. Expressing sizes, such as margins and
    paddings, in <code>em</code> means they are related to the font
    size, and if the user has a big font (e.g., on a big screen) or a
    small font (e.g., on a handheld device), the sizes will be in
    proportion. Declarations such as <code>text-indent: 1.5em</code>
    and <code>margin: 1em</code> are extremely common in CSS.

   <p>The <code>ex</code> unit is rarely used. Its purpose is to
    express sizes that must be related to the x-height of a font. The
    x-height is, roughly, the height of lowercase letters such as <em
    >a, c, m,</em> or <em>o.</em> Fonts that have the same size (and
    thus the same <code>em</code>) may vary wildly in the size of
    their lowercase letters, and when it is important that some image,
    e.g., matches the x-height, the <code>ex</code> unit is
    available.

   <p>The <code>px</code> unit is the magic unit of CSS. It is not
    related to the current font and usually not related to physical
    centimeters or inches either. The <code>px</code> unit is defined
    to be small but visible, and such that a horizontal 1px wide line
    can be displayed with sharp edges (no anti-aliasing). What is
    sharp, small and visible depends on the device and the way it is
    used: do you hold it close to your eyes, like a mobile phone, at
    arms length, like a computer monitor, or somewhere in between, like
    an e-book reader? The <code>px</code> is thus not defined as a
    constant length, but as something that depends on the type of
    device and its typical use.

   <p>To get an idea of the appearance of a <code>px</code>, imagine
    a CRT computer monitor from the 1990s: the smallest dot it can
    display measures about 1/100th of an inch (0.25mm) or a little
    more. The <code>px</code> unit got its name from those screen
    pixels.

   <p>Nowadays there are devices that could in principle display
    smaller sharp dots (although you might need a magnifier to see
    them). But documents from the last century that used <code
    >px</code> in CSS still look the same, no matter what the device.
    Printers, especially, can display sharp lines with much smaller
    details than 1px, but even on printers, a 1px line looks very much
    the same as it would look on a computer monitor. Devices change,
    but the <code>px</code> always has the same visual appearance.

   <div class=hint>
    <p>In fact, CSS requires that <code>1px</code> must be exactly
     1/96th of an inch in all printed output. CSS considers that
     printers, unlike screens, do not need to have different sizes for
     <code>px</code> in order to print sharp lines. In print media, a
     px thus not only has the same visual appearance from one device to
     another, but indeed it is measurably the same.
   </div>

   <p>CSS also defines that raster images (such as photos) are, by
    default, displayed with one image pixel mapping to 1px. A photo
    with a 600 by 400 resolution will be 600px wide and 400px high. The
    pixels in the photo thus do not map to pixels of the display device
    (which may be very small), but map to <code>px</code> units. That
    makes it possible to exactly align images to other elements of a
    document, as long as you use <code>px</code> units in your style
    sheet, and not <code>pt</code>, <code>cm</code>, etc.
  </div>

  <div class=section id=font-size>
   <h2>Use <code>em</code> or <code>px</code> for font sizes</h2>

   <p>CSS inherited the units <code>pt</code> (point) and <code
    >pc</code> (pica) from typography. Printers have traditionally
    used those and similar units in preference to <code>cm</code> or
    <code>in</code>. In CSS there is no reason to use <code>pt</code
    >, use whichever unit you prefer. But there <em>is</em> a good
    reason to use <em>neither <code>pt</code> nor any other absolute
    unit</em> and only use <code>em</code> and <code>px</code>.

   <div class=hint>
    <p>Here are a few lines of different thickness. Some or all of
     them may look sharp, but at least the 1px and 2px lines should be
     sharp and visible:

    <p style="line-height: 3.2"> <span
     style="padding: 1em 0; border-left: 0.5pt solid">0.5pt,</span>
     <span style="padding: 1em 0; border-left: 1px solid">1px,</span>
     <span style="padding: 1em 0; border-left: 1pt solid">1pt,</span>
     <span style="padding: 1em 0; border-left: 1.5px solid"
     >1.5px,</span> <span
     style="padding: 1em 0; border-left: 2px solid">2px</span>

    <p>If the first four lines all look the same (or if the 0.5pt line
     is missing), you are probably looking at a computer monitor that
     cannot display dots smaller than 1px. If the lines appear to
     increase in thickness, you are probably looking at this page on a
     high-quality computer screen or on paper. And if 1pt looks thicker
     than 1.5px, you probably have a handheld screen.
   </div>

   <p>The magic unit of CSS, the <code>px</code>, is a often a good
    unit to use, especially if the style requires alignment of text to
    images, or simply because anything that is 1px wide or a multiple
    of 1px is guaranteed to look sharp.

   <p>But for font sizes it is even better to use <code>em</code>.
    The idea is (1) to not set the font size of the BODY element (in
    HTML), but use the default size of the device, because that is a
    size that the reader can comfortably read; and (2) express font
    sizes of other elements in <code>em</code>: <code>H1 {font-size:
    2.5em}</code> to make the H1 2½ times as big as the normal, body
    font.

   <p>The only place where you could use <code>pt</code> (or <code
    >cm</code> or <code>in</code>) for setting a font size is in
    style sheets for print, if you need to be sure the printed font is
    exactly a certain size. But even there using the default font size
    is usually better.

   <div class=hint>
    <p>The <code>px</code> unit thus shields you from having to know
     the resolution of the device. Whether the output is 96 dpi,
     100 dpi, 220 dpi or 1800 dpi, a length expressed as a whole number
     of <code>px</code> always looks good and very similar across all
     devices. But what if you <em>do</em> want to know the resolution
     of the device, e.g., to know if it is safe to use a <code
     >0.5px</code> line? The answer is to check the resolution via <a
     href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">Media Queries.</a>
     Explaining Media Queries is out of scope for this article, but
     here is a small example:

    <pre>
div.mybox { border: 2px solid }
@media (min-resolution: 2dppx) {
  /* Media with 2 or more dots per px */
  div.mybox { border: 1.5px solid }
}
</pre>
   </div>
  </div>

  <div class=section id=future>
   <h2>More units in CSS</h2>

   <p>To make it even easier to write style rules that depend only on
    the default font size, CSS has since 2013 a new unit: the <code
    >rem</code>. The <code>rem</code> (for “root em”) is the font
    size of the root element of the document. Unlike the <code
    >em</code>, which may be different for each element, the <code
    >rem</code> is constant throughout the document. E.g., to give P
    and H1 elements the same left margin, compare this pre-2013 style
    sheet:

   <pre>p { margin-left: 1em }
h1 { font-size: 3em; margin-left: 0.333em }</pre>

   <p>with the new version:

   <pre>p { margin-left: 1rem }
h1 { font-size: 3em; margin-left: 1rem }</pre>

   <p>Other new units make it possible to specify sizes relative to
    the reader's window. These are the <code>vw</code> and <code
    >vh</code>. The <code>vw</code> is 1/100th of the window's width
    and the <code>vh</code> is 1/100th of the window's height. There
    is also <code>vmin</code>, which stands for whichever is the
    smallest of <code>vw</code> and <code>vh</code>. And <code
    >vmax</code>. (You can guess what it does.)

   <p>Because they are so new, they don't work everywhere yet. But, as
    of early 2015, several browsers support them.
